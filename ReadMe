# Faculty and Student Assignment & Work Sharing System

## Overview
This project is a web-based application designed to make assignment and work sharing easier between faculty and students. It allows faculty to assign tasks/homework to students either batchwise or classwise, while students can view and submit their assignments. Faculty can then provide remarks based on the submissions, and these remarks will be visible to the students.

The system is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **PHP**, and **Bootstrap** to ensure a responsive and user-friendly experience.
